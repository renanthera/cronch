I have several samples for all of the different behaviour from this week. In every case, inspect the Brewmaster Monk named "Katebruwu"

Case 1: <https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/7xNnGhDMK19vtVYF#fight=1&source=20> (Incorrect accumulator, Valdrakken Cleave Target Dummies w/ other people)

Case 2: <https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/7xNnGhDMK19vtVYF#fight=6&source=20> (Correct accumulator, Turnip Punching Bag, Solo, No White Tiger Statue / Niuzao)

Case 3: <https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/7xNnGhDMK19vtVYF#fight=17&source=20> (Correct accumulator, Turnip Punching Bag, Solo, White Tiger Statue + Niuzao)



Throughout the following two logs (excerpts of the first were used in the listed cases), there are several other samples of this behaviour.

The impact varies, but I have not seen a case where I measure correct accumulator behaviour when fighting target dummies with other people also fighting them this week.

Test methodology notes:
- Against each target dummy configuration:
- Perform standard rotation against the selected target dummies and press CB fairly frequently.
- Some tests were performed without Invoke Niuzao and White Tiger Statue to rule out non-player sources failing to be accumulated.

Measurement methodology notes:
- Code can be found at <https://github.com/renanthera/crunch/tree/python-v2/python>. I apologize in advance, a lot of this is pretty old and commits many crimes.
- All query configuration and data processing is done in `python/main.py`.
- This system was working excellently previous weeks, and it matches up in Case 2 and Case 3 perfectly.
- Using the WCL v2 API, acquire the following three queries given a `startTime`, `endTime`, `reportCode`, and `sourceID`. These examples are pre-filled for Case 1.
```
{reportData{report(code:"7xNnGhDMK19vtVYF"){events(dataType:DamageDone abilityID:425299 startTime:34 endTime:317258 useAbilityIDs:true sourceID:20){data nextPageTimestamp}}}}
{reportData{report(code:"7xNnGhDMK19vtVYF"){events(dataType:DamageDone abilityID:406764 startTime:34 endTime:317258 useAbilityIDs:true sourceID:20){data nextPageTimestamp}}}}
{reportData{report(code:"7xNnGhDMK19vtVYF"){events(dataType:Buffs abilityID:425965 startTime:34 endTime:317258 useAbilityIDs:true sourceID:20){data nextPageTimestamp}}}}
```
- Merge events into a single list sorted by timestamp.
- Iterate over the entries in our list.
- If the spell id is `425299`, increment accumulator (`amt`) by `unimitigatedAmount`. Technically not guaranteed to be correct against targets with magic DRs, but effective in this case to manage overkill. Previous weeks strongly suggested overkill is included in accumulator.
- If spell ID is `425965` and the `type` is `applybuff`, capture `absorb` for absorb mean tracking, and report `absorb` and accumulator (`amt`). Additionally computes some potentially useful ratios to divine what is occurring.
- Once every event is consumed, print average applied `absorb` just to make us cry.

Possible test issues:
- Cleave Dummy v Turnip behaviour could be different. Hard to control for unless I can somehow figure out what is causing it and reproduce it on a Turnip OR get a variety of specs to assist on a turnip.

Data notes:
- As Case 2 and 3 are accurate, this is highly probable to rule out monk/brm-specific behaviour causing the discrepancy in case 1 (and other samples).
- I have noticed discrepancies going back a fair while with the accumulator, but the behaviours were understood to be caused by Chaos Brand, and then Crit (via CF) and Vers scaling the absorb.
- The magnitude no longer matches up with Chaos Brand.
- The magnitude also varies slightly. It is significant enough of a variance that it is improbable to be caused by roundoff behaviours.
- The effect is pretty consistent throughout a single sample. This suggests that the effect that is causing the small variance has pretty high uptime and/or varies incredibly often.
- The "varies often" hypothesis would result in events being logged, as relevant buff events would exist in the segment, unless the effect is not logged (despair).
- The discrepancy could be caused by several effects simultaneously.
- Case 1 had only had a single buff applied to my character. It is highly improbable that the source of the issue was Essence Font...
- Case 1 had only a few candidates for possible debuffs causing the issue. Given how many problems currently exist around Sigil of Flame, it's not improbable that that is the cause.
