Create a [Warcraftlogs v2 API client](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/api/clients/) with a descriptive name and a redirect of `https://localhost`, with PKCE client checked.

Provide the client id as an environment variable upon first execution.

Your default browser should open, prompting you to authorize the API client.

Upon authorization, copy the value of the `code` url parameter, and paste it into the client.
