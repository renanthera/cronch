Abandoned in favor of simc work. Potentially revived through simc in the long run to handle the gameplay implementation details.

Very fun re-exploration of C++ to gather data from the Warcraftlogs v2 API to compute useful approximations of class behaviours.
A lot of this code will look REALLY stupid and like I'm reinventing the wheel.

If you want to use the very questionable python warcraftlogs v2 api script, you must supply your own v2 api credentials.
